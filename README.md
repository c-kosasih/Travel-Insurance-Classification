# ðŸ§³ Travel Insurance Claim Classification
This project aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of travel insurance claim processing using Machine Learning. Insurance companies often face high volumes of claims influenced by various factors, which can slow down decision-making and increase the risk of errors. Meanwhile, customers expect a fast and reliable claims process.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Leverage ML models to predict the likelihood of a claim, enabling:

- âš¡ Faster claim decisions

- âœ… Reduced human error

- ðŸ“ˆ Improved operational efficiency

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Highlights
- Model performance evaluated using ROC Curve

- Applied hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy

- Balanced focus on precision and recall to minimize misclassification

## ðŸ’¥ Impact
Implementing ML in this workflow helps:

- Speed up simple claim approvals

- Allow human adjusters to focus on complex cases

- Increase customer satisfaction through responsive and accurate service
